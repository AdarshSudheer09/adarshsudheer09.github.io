        How It All Started
    </h2>
    <p>
        In 1891, James Naismith had a problem, he was a teacher, and his students were forced indoors as it was winter
        time, because of this they misbehaved. They had loads of energy but had no way to use it,they couldn’t play any
        sports because of the weather. Because of this the school asked him to create a new sport, he got the idea of a
        game where you throw a ball at a target, and the team that hit the target the most won. Naismith called his
        sport basketball, and wrote 13 basic rules.
    </p>
    <p>
        The 13 original rules of Basketball are:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.
        </li>
        <li>
            The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands (never with the fist).
        </li>
        <li>
            A player cannot run with the ball. The player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, an
            allowance to be made for a man who catches the ball when running at a good speed if he tries to stop.
        </li>
        <li>
            The ball must be held in or between the hands; the arms or body must not be used for holding it.
        </li>
        <li>
            No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping, or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be
            allowed; the first infringement of this rule by any player shall count as a foul, the second shall
            disqualify him until the next goal is made, or, if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the
            whole of the game, no substitute allowed.
        </li>
        <li>
            A foul is striking at the ball with the fist, violation of Rules 3,4, and such as described in Rule 5.
        </li>
        <li>
            If either side makes three consecutive fouls, it shall count a goal for the opponents
        </li>
        <li>
            A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from the grounds into the basket and stays there,
            providing those defending the goal do not touch or disturb the goal. If the ball rests on the edges, and the
            opponent moves the basket, it shall count as a goal.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the ball goes out of bounds, it shall be thrown into the field of play by the person first touching it.
            In case of a dispute, the umpire shall throw it straight into the field. The thrower-in is allowed five
            seconds; if he holds it longer, it shall go to the opponent. If any side persists in delaying the game, the
            umpire shall call a foul on that side.
        </li>
        <li>
            The umpire shall be the judge of the men and shall note the fouls and notify the referee when three
            consecutive fouls have been made. He shall have power to disqualify men according to Rule 5.
        </li>
        <li>
            The referee shall be the judge of the ball and shall decide when the ball is in play, in bounds, to which
            side it belongs, and shall keep the time. He shall decide when a goal has been made, and keep account of the
            goals with any other duties that are usually performed by a referee.
        </li>
        <li>
            The time shall be two 15-minute halves, with five minutes' rest between.
        </li>
        <li>
            The side making the most goals in that time shall be declared the winner. In case of a draw, the game may,
            by agreement of the captains, be continued until another goal is made.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
        How the NBA was Created
    </h3>
    <p>
        In the present day when we think of basketball, we think of the NBA, however it wasn’t always like this. The NBA
        has a totally different story on how it got created.

        The BAA incorporated in 1946. This challenged the nine year old Nbl. To compete with the Nbl the baa established
        itself into bigger cities than the nbl as the nbl only existed in smaller midwestern cities like Fort Wayne,
        Sheboygan, and Akron. “Another example would be that the nbl held its games in small gymnasiums whereas the baa
        played its games in large major market arenas such as the Boston Garden and New York City’s Madison Square
        Garden.” By 1948 the BAA had begun to attract some of the best players in the country. Because of this, four NBL
        franchises - Fort Wayne, Indianapolis, Minneapolis, and Rochester moved to the baa, bringing their best players
        with them. One example would be George Mikan, he was basically the Micheal Jordan of his era. The team he was on
        was practically guaranteed to win the championship. George Mikan ended up moving to the Minneapolis Lakers.

        On August 3, 1949, one representative from each league met up to finalize the merging of the leagues. The new
        NBA was made of 17 teams that represented both small towns and large cities all across the country.

        However this wasn’t happy ever after. Through the 1950’s the number of teams dwindled, along with fan support
        and by 1954, only 8 teams remained. Due to the league starting to fade the league invented a new 24 second shot
        clock. This made the game much more fast paced and more exciting for fans to watch. Because of this fans
        returned and the league finally established. Throughout the 1960’s and 70’s the NBA expanded and now millions of
        fans from all around the world watch the NBA. And that is the amazing story of how on June 6, 1946, New York,
        NY, the NBA was created.

        Getting it to Perfection
    </H2>
    <p>
        The original game of basketball was amazing at that era, but it still needed a lot of improvement, for example
        one minor change was the ball, originally it was a soccer/basketball made of leather. But they became unsuitable
        for dribbling and ball handling. In the late 1890’s Spalding was the official basketball maker. However in 1905
        the choice of basketballs was a choice for the team to decide. Since they couldn’t maintain shale and their
        laces, the early brown leather basketballs were hard to dribble. However later on they stopped stitching the
        ball and made it a bit bigger and easier to bounce. Currently the basketball is made of artificial synthetic
        leather.

    <h3>
        Baskets
    </h3>
    <p>
        Another thing would be baskets. Originally it was played with peach baskets or square boxes hung from balconies.
        One bad thing about peach baskets is that whenever someone scored, it slowed down the game as they had to take
        it down and retrieve the ball. Then the peach baskets were replaced with woven wire rims in 1892. A year later
        cast iron rims were used. Then in 1912 open ended nylon nets were in use. This was a major milestone, as now the
        ball fell down from the hoop itself which increased the tempo and speed of the game. They also introduced a 24
        second clock later on in 1954, which increased the tempo and speed of the game even more. Continuing on with the
        hoop, the backboard also changed. Originally it was wire mesh backboards to prevent fans interrupting gameplay.
        Then wood replaced the wire as it didn’t dent as easily. “Backboards were mounted flat against walls, but in
        1916 to prevent players running up the walls for easy lay-ups a two foot gap was introduced in-between the
        backboard and the endline.”
