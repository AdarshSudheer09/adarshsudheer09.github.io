      How It All Started 
    </H2>
    <p>
        In 1891, James Naismith had a problem, he was a teacher, and his students were forced indoors as it was winter time, because of this they misbehaved. They had loads of energy but had no way to use it,they couldnâ€™t play any sports because of the weather. Because of this the school asked him to create a new sport, he got the idea of a game where you throw a ball at a target, and the team that hit the target the most won. Naismith called his sport basketball, and wrote 13 basic rules.

        The 13 original rules of Basketball are:

    <p>
        1. The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.

        2. The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands (never with the fist).

        3. A player cannot run with the ball. The player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, an allowance to be made for a man who catches the ball when running at a good speed if he tries to stop.

        4. The ball must be held in or between the hands; the arms or body must not be used for holding it.
